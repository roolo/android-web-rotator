# Web rotator

This is my first app for trying [RubyMotion](http://www.rubymotion.com) for Android app development. It is shows different pages in WebView in specific interval. I created this app in copy pasta style from example apps [Timer](https://github.com/HipByte/RubyMotionSamples/tree/master/android/Timer) and [WebViewDemo](https://github.com/HipByte/RubyMotionSamples/tree/master/android/WebViewDemo).
